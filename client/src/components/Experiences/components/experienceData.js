The ticket remains valid through the day and you can visit the landmark anytime between 9:00 AM and 8:00 PM when the last entry is granted. Unconventional though Casa Mila's appearance may be, the actual purpose of the structure is as conventional as it can be. After all, the building is, first and foremost, residential in nature. It's hard imagining that the place was designed to be anyone's home, but as you walk through Casa Mila's lavishly adorned lobbies or the sprawling courtyards peppered with Gaudi's signature embellishments, living here seems like a dream come true. Touring the Casa Mila by day involves visiting two different parts of the museum - the Espai Gaudi and the Pedera Apartment. The former includes a broad showcase of Guadi’s work and is divided into sections dedicated to different projects and shows his life in broad strokes. The latter is a fascinating recreation of the home of a bourgeois family in Barcelona from the first third of the 20th century. Perhaps the true treasure of the building is the view from the rooftop that is decorated with distinctive corkscrew style chimneys, synonymous with the building itself. The view of Barcelona's skyline from the top of the structure is nothing short of breathtaking so any time spent here is time well spent. Enhance your trip with the free audio guide included on this tour which will give you information on the main areas of the building, the sites you can visit and the architect himself. Once the 90-minute long commentary that is available in multiple languages on the audio guide runs out, you are more than free to explore on your own.",

Inside the basilica, your guide will show you the extreme designs incorporated into the church’s construction and the finely detailed works of the beautiful stained glass windows.\nOther than the Sagrada Familia, you will also be able to visit the Sagrada Familia Museum. The museum started out as a school by Antoni Gaudi for the children of those working on the construction of the Sagrada Familia. Today, it is a museum dedicated to the basilica and to Antoni Gaudi as well.

The history and spirituality of the region is very deeply tied to this place and many believe that Catalonia's identity is rooted in Montserrat, possibly due to the fact that the Virgin of Montserrat residing in the Basilica is the patron saint of the region. Your guide will walk you through the atrium, as well as the Basilica which houses the famous 12th-century Romanesque carving of the Verge Moreneta, better known as the Black Madonna. You will also get a chance to marvel at the architecture of the external facade, the cloisters, and Santa Maria square before being given a half hour to explore the farmers market or grab a bite to eat.\nYou will then travel to the foot of the mountain to the grounds of the Oller del Mas winery, one of the most important wineries in the region for having achieved the \"vi di finca\", the highest level of distinction for a Spanish wine, as well as having won the \"Best Wine Experience\" award a couple of years ago. The cellars of this winery are located in a castle that was built in the 10th century, which your guide will help you both navigate and explore as a part of this tour. Walk through the vineyards, the wine production areas and the barrel rooms as well, so you can truly understand and appreciate the art that is winemaking before sitting down to enjoy a scrumptious cold tapas lunch with dessert, paired with three homegrown, ecological wines. If you're vegetarian or allergic to gluten, don't worry! Your guide will take a note of dietary restrictions at the start of the tour. Having had your fill of good food, wine and having taken in the beauty of the Catalonian region, you will make your way back to Barcelona.",

This is due to the rough-hewn appearance that envelops the outer portion of this modernist building. Planned as a spiritual symbol, the building features multiple carvings and statues of Mary and the archangels. The building is among the most charming masterpieces of Gaudi and during the night a secret side emerges to this building. Twisting corridors that transport you inside a cave; sea waves concealing marine life, chimneys resembling giant warriors and a plethora of forms comes to life in the starlight. This is one Gaudi experience in Barcelona that you just cannot miss.\nYour Experience\nYou experience begins at the Casa Mila entrance where you will meet your guide. After that, you will head inside the building to explore the dreamy design and architecture that Gaudi's creations are famous for. The tour will take you to various sections of the building such as the Provença and Passeig de Gràcia courtyard, the Roof-Terrace and the Espai Gaudí (the attic).\nWhat sets the Origin experience apart though is the stunning audio-visual show that is held on Casa Mila's rooftop. This immersive experience not only highlights the importance of Casa Mila in the architectural timeline of Barcelona but also gives you deep insights into Gaudi's design approach and implementation.\nOnce you have explored the building with your guide and the show has ended, the tour will come to a close with a glass of glass of cava and chocolate snacks as refreshments.",
